Javascript is 
-> synchronous (by default )
-> single threaded (comparitively slower)
 
js always present along with some other runtime engine - maybe in browser 
so js not always seems so slow 
Execution control/ Global execution context 
-> execute one line of code at a time 
 console log-> 1
 console log-> 2
 each operation waits for the last one to complete before execution 
 call stack 
 memory heap
