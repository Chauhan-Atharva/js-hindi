Javascript is 
-> synchronous (by default )
-> single threaded (comparitively slower)
 
js always present along with some other runtime engine - maybe in browser 
so js not always seems so slow 
Execution control/ Global execution context 
-> execute one line of code at a time 
 console log-> 1
 console log-> 2
 each operation waits for the last one to complete before execution 
 call stack 
 memory heap

 Call back 
 A callback is a function passed as an argument to another function, which is then executed after the completion of that function. Callbacks are commonly used in JavaScript for handling asynchronous operations like API calls, file reading, or event handling.

How Callbacks Work
A function is passed as an argument to another function.
The receiving function executes the callback at the appropriate time.
